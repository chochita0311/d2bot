# Evaluation Template

## Metadata
- ID: `eval-0000`
- Status: `draft`
- Evaluator Type: `contract` | `design` | `functional` | `ux-heuristic`
- Result: `PASS` | `PASS WITH SUGGESTIONS` | `FAIL`
- Run ID:
- Attempt:
- Feature: `[feat-0000-title](../feature/feat-0000-title.md)`
- Spec: `[spec-0000-title](../spec/spec-0000-title.md)`
- Execution Profile:
- Surface Lane:
- Evidence Coverage: `complete` | `partial` | `unavailable`
- Created: `YYYY-MM-DD`

For `docs-content`, replace the Spec example with the designated writing contract’s real ID and repository-relative file or section anchor. Do not invent a spec file.

## Scope
- Active feature:
- Active spec:
- Evaluated build or commit:

## Checks
- List the checks actually performed.

## Evidence
- Environments checked: source inspection, automated tests, fresh isolated runtime, active long-running runtime, rendered browser, or another relevant surface.
- Record only directly observed evidence and identify synthetic fixtures or approved runtime data boundaries.
- Select applicable detailed checks from [Design Evaluation](../../policies/design/design-evaluation.md) and [Interaction Evaluation](../../policies/experience/interaction-evaluation.md) when those review assets are installed. Record the concrete witness, owner, peer consumers, state transitions, and limitations required by the active feature.
- For source normalization, complex collection or scroll behavior, remote or multi-target actions, and long-running work, follow the relevant owned checks rather than treating a generic fixture or successful endpoint as sufficient evidence.
- For generated analysis, identify comparison inputs and configuration, original outputs, review scope, and observed variation. Separate content, interface, application, and user-outcome evidence using the corresponding Interaction Evaluation checks; identify settings that were only requested and outcomes that were not observed.

## Evidence Gaps
- List required but unavailable evidence and the claims that remain unverified.
- Owning requirement: feature acceptance point, spec requirement, or profile evidence rule.
- Acceptance impact: `blocking` | `non-blocking` | `not applicable`.
- Keep `Result` for the evaluator outcome; do not invent a new result label to encode evidence coverage.
- A `PASS` with partial or unavailable evidence must state whether the gap blocks acceptance under the owning feature, spec, or profile.

## Contract Evidence
- Use when evaluator type is `contract`.
- Producer surfaces:
- Consumer surfaces:
- Schemas, payloads, generated artifacts, commands, routes, config, or policy docs checked:
- Stale-assumption check:

## Findings
- For each finding, record:
  - severity
  - classification: `implementation bug` | `spec gap` | `planning gap` | `suggestion`
  - description
  - evidence
  - fix hint

## Regression Notes
- Name any regression surfaces checked and their status.

## Route
- Next action:
  - `fix`
  - `spec-review`
  - `planning-review`
  - `pass`

## Continuity Notes
- Add dated notes when this report is revised.
